# Looking for info on how to install Vanguard into BattleScribe ? 

We have an official BS repository called 'Kings of War - Vanguard'.

The latest official version of this project are thus available via the BattleScribe Manage Data functionality ( in the roster executable ) or via the [BattleScribe Data Files App](https://battlescribedata.appspot.com/#/repos)
