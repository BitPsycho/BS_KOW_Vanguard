## Introduction 


### Vanguard

From the Vanguard web site:

_**YOUR WARBAND, YOUR STORY...**_

_Vanguard recreates cinematic, brutal skirmishes between small warbands of handpicked fighters, set in the same universe as our hugely popular Kings of War wargame. Players carefully select their squad of characters then fight it out to complete life or death missions - that can help turn the tide in the battle to come!_
